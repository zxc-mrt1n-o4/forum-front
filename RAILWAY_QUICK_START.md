# Railway Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\deploy-railway.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x deploy-railway.sh
./deploy-railway.sh
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
```bash
railway up
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Frontend logs
npm run logs:frontend

# Backend logs  
npm run logs:backend
```

## 📋 Quick Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `railway login` | Login to Railway |
| `railway up` | Deploy both services |
| `railway logs --service frontend` | View frontend logs |
| `railway logs --service backend` | View backend logs |
| `railway variables` | View environment variables |
| `railway status` | Check deployment status |

## 🔧 Required Environment Variables

Only one variable needs to be set manually:

```bash
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
```

All other variables are auto-generated by Railway.

## 🌐 Service URLs

After deployment, you'll get two URLs:
- **Frontend**: `https://your-frontend.railway.app`
- **Backend**: `https://your-backend.railway.app`

## ✅ Post-Deployment Checklist

1. [ ] Both services deployed successfully
2. [ ] Frontend loads without errors
3. [ ] Backend API responds to health check
4. [ ] User registration works
5. [ ] Admin panel accessible
6. [ ] Create first admin user
